# CS50-games

Repository where I will develop the different assignments for the HarvardX CS50 Game Development course.
Version 1.

All the games are fully operational and I have almost finished all the tasks necessary to obtain the certification but one of the functions in the "match" game (a Candy Crush clone) has some bug I have not been able to locate and the final project that entails the development of a complete game and is barely started. The reason for both of these things is that I run out of quarentine time, though I hope to finish it when I find some time because the project is a welcome challenge; but for the moment it will have to remain in stand-by.
