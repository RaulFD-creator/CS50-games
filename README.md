# CS50-games

Repository where I will develop the different assignments for the HarvardX CS50 Game Development course.
Version 1.

All the games are fully operational and I have almost finished all the tasks necessary to obtain the certification but one of the functions in the "match" game (a Candy Crush clone) has some bug and the final project that entails the development of a complete game is barely started. The reason for this is a run out of quarentine time.
